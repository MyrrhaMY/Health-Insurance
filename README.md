Predictive Model: Customer Churn in Health Insurance
Goal: Predict which customers are likely to cancel their insurance policies (churn) so that the company can take proactive measures (e.g., offering personalized incentives, discounts, or improved service).

1. Problem Definition
Health insurance companies face customer churn, where policyholders cancel their plans after a certain period. This leads to:
	•	Revenue loss (losing a paying customer).
	•	Higher acquisition costs (new customer acquisition is more expensive than retention).
	•	Reduced profitability (if healthier customers leave, the risk pool becomes worse).

Key Business Questions:
	1	Which customers are most likely to churn?
	2	What are the key factors driving churn?
	3	How can we intervene early to retain high-value customers?

2. Data Collection
To predict churn, we need historical customer data from multiple sources:
Customer Demographics:
	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	Income level
	•	Education level
	•	Marital status
	•	Employment status

Insurance Policy Details:
	•	Plan type (e.g., HMO, PPO, high-deductible)
	•	Premium amount ($)
	•	Deductible amount ($)
	•	Co-pay amount ($)
	•	Coverage details (dental, vision, prescription drugs)
	•	Policy tenure (how long they’ve been a customer)

Customer Behavior Data:
	•	Number of claims filed in the last year
	•	Claim amount ($)
	•	Number of customer service calls
	•	Call sentiment (positive/negative)
	•	Number of late payments
	•	Website/app usage frequency

Churn Label (Target Variable):
	•	1 = Churned (Customer canceled their insurance within X months).
	•	0 = Retained (Customer remained active).

3. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
	1	Handle Missing Data
	◦	Fill missing values with mean/median (numerical) or mode (categorical).
	◦	Use KNN imputation for missing demographic data.
	2	Feature Engineering
	◦	Create policy tenure groups (0-6 months, 6-12 months, etc.).
	◦	Extract sentiment scores from customer service call transcripts.
	◦	Calculate claim frequency per customer.
	3	Convert Categorical Data
	◦	Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., plan type).
	◦	Use label encoding for ordinal variables (e.g., education level).
	4	Normalize Numerical Features
	◦	Scale all numeric values (e.g., income, claim amount) using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.

4. Model Selection & Training
Step 1: Train-Test Split
	•	80% Training Data
	•	20% Test Data

Step 2: Choose Model Algorithms
We will experiment with different models and select the best based on performance.
Baseline Model:
	•	Logistic Regression (for interpretability).
Advanced Models:
	•	Random Forest (handles feature importance well).
	•	XGBoost (for high accuracy).
	•	Neural Networks (if we have a very large dataset).
Step 3: Train the Model
Example using Python (XGBoost):
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

5. Model Evaluation
We evaluate the model using multiple metrics:
	•	Accuracy: Measures overall correctness.
	•	Precision & Recall: Important for class imbalance (if churners are rare).
	•	AUC-ROC Score: Measures how well the model distinguishes between churners and non-churners.
Example output:
Accuracy: 85%
Precision (Churn): 78%
Recall (Churn): 82%
AUC-ROC: 0.91

6. Feature Importance Analysis
Once we have a trained model, we analyze which factors contribute most to churn.
Example feature importance from XGBoost:
Feature
Importance Score
Number of Late Payments
0.25
Customer Service Calls
0.18
Policy Tenure
0.15
Income Level
0.10
Number of Claims
0.08
Key Insights:
	1	Late payments and customer service complaints are strong churn indicators.
	2	Longer policy tenure customers are less likely to churn.
	3	Low-income customers are more price-sensitive.

7. Business Action Plan
1. Proactive Retention Strategies
	•	Identify high-risk customers (e.g., late payers, frequent claimers).
	•	Offer personalized retention incentives (discounts, loyalty rewards).
	•	Improve customer service response time.
2. Dynamic Pricing Adjustments
	•	Adjust premiums based on risk level.
	•	Offer customized plan recommendations for at-risk customers.
3. Personalized Customer Outreach
	•	Automate reminders for premium payments.
	•	Send loyalty rewards for long-term customers.
	•	Offer customized plan upgrades based on usage patterns.

8. Future Improvements
	•	Use time-series forecasting for churn probability over time.
	•	Test causal AI models to see which interventions actually reduce churn.
	•	Implement real-time churn alerts for customer service teams.
